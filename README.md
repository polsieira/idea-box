## General Info

<h4>A project for practicing HTML, CSS, and diving deeper into JavaScript in Turing Front-End Engineering course, Module 1. Completed in group of three using GitHub as remote repository.</h4>


## Motivation
Of course IdeaBox helped solidify the concepts of HTML5 and CSS3, however the true test was with the functionality in JavaScript. The project was introduced in two parts to emphasize the importance of writing clean, DRY, dynamic code. The functionality stresses the importance of saving data to local storage and pulling information back to the webpage on reload to ensure that elements persist. Also, IdeaBox implemented event bubbling to manipulate elements on the DOM to create a more interactive experience for the user. See the part one of the comp <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-redux-wk1.html">here</a> and part two <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-redux-wk2.html">here</a>.
